## Overview

The purpose of this project was to explore Gesture-Based UI. 
The technology I chose to use was the Myo Armband, designed by Thalmic Labs. 
I designed a game where zombies are spawned on screen when a player enter the trigger, and you have to shoot them 
before they attack you.
The Myo armband is used to control your aim and to fire shoots as well.
